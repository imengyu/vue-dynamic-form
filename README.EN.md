## Introduction

In the management system development, we often use form submission data, and form submission data takes up most of the development time.
When the form is very large, manually writing the form components can be a hassle. vue-dynamic-form was written to solve this problem,
vue-dynamic-form allows you to dynamically generate forms using JSON data. You only need to pass in a JSON containing various description information to render a complete form.

vue-dynamic-form is not required for development, it is just a widget to help you speed up development.

The management system projects used by the author's company have all used dynamic forms, saving 80% of the time of layout forms, and the development efficiency has been greatly improved (you can spend more time to touch the fish ðŸ¤­). vue-dynamic-form is now open source, hoping to facilitate your development.
